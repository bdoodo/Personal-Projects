# polygon-redesign

## Timeframe
Day 0: Looked over Docker documentation at a high-level. Journaled notes about Polygon's philosophy.  

Day 1: Prototyped on Adobe XD (https://xd.adobe.com/view/ab4b5fe3-6689-4bc5-a25d-d6c95ac939ee-fe18). Looked over documentation on Vue essentials + modular components; started to look over Vuetify documentation.

Day 2: Continued with Vuetify documentation. Made basic structuring of the web page.

## Design
To turn DuckDuckGo into a Polygon product, I wanted to keep the layout as close as possible to the original's while incorporating Polygon's content and feel: Its typography, colors, polygons, and overall safe, friendly, community-oriented nature. Where possible, I made direct subsitutions: For example, the three DuckDuckGo cards are replaced by the three cards from the Polygon site. While the overall flow is the same – drawing the user's eye in a straight line down the page, with each step urging any remaining viewers to click 'get started' – the page is made instantly more friendly by Polygon's flat, dichromatic, character-driven design.
