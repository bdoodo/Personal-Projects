This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses React components from [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) and type libraries for using Typescript with React.

## To start:

### Install dependencies with `npm install`

### Build a production bundle with `npm run build`

### Start a server to serve the production bundle

Try Serve: Run `npm install serve -g` if you don't have it installed. Once it's installed and the build bundle is ready, run 'serve -s build' in the root directory to start a server.
